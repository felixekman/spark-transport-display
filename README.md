About
===
With a Spark Core and this software you can: Check the current time, the weather forecast and the bus' next departure at a glance. The information is displayed using a colored LED and an OLED display. 

The colored LED  shows when it is the right time to leave and catch a bus. (Green=Good to go, Orange=Run!, Red=too late)


**Data**: The data source is http://opentt.herokuapp.com/ (a modified version of http://transport.opendata.ch/) 

**Device**: It is realized with a [Spark Core Firmware](http://spark.io). It calls the transport api over HTTP and parses the result.
